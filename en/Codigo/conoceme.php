        I like to say that I'm a writer of my most creative logical thoughts, because
        both in programming and in cybersecurity when you write code it must have a logic like any algorithm, and build it while
        have a logic like any algorithm, and build it as you use creativity to solve an issue.
        to solve an issue. The roles within this profession are rarely seen as creative jobs, however creativity is not
        creative, however creativity is not a product of using only one side of our brain, that is a myth.
        of our brain, that is a myth, creativity arises when regions of the brain communicate with each other, particularly the
        communicate with each other, especially the default network that is active when we let our mind wander as in dreaming.
        our mind to wander like daydreaming producing interesting creative ideas,
        but when you focus on an idea and direct thought, another network of the brain is activated, called the executive control network, which
        network called the executive control network evaluating each idea that is generated, so the first network creates spontaneous connections and the second network creates spontaneous connections.
        network creates spontaneous connections and the second network judges which of those ideas are good, so the development of code. ... does not involve the use of only one side of our brain but rather the
        communication between its zones, in effect programming is as creative an act as many.

        I specialize in back-end development of Restful APIs for payments and fintech with technologies such as Python, Grails, Spring Boot and NodeJS
        with technologies such as Python, Grails, Spring Boot and NodeJS in microservices architectures.
        microservices architectures. I have 6 years of experience as a computer engineer in different companies or organizations, and I have
        different companies and organizations, and I have stood out as a speaker in cybersecurity and programming
        cybersecurity and programming events. During the development of my professional career
        I have collaborated in different technological communities, and I have founded the first community of women programmers in Venezuela Rails Girls, since I am passionate about contributing to reduce the gender gap in the technology sector, I have taught in-person and online trainings, with special focus on programming, promoting the use of free software tools.

        After the start of the COVID-19 pandemic period and the storm that broke out in cyberspace with the rise of cybercrime and misinformation, I decided to take a more formal step towards cybersecurity.
        in cyberspace with the increase in cybercrime and disinformation, I decided to take a more formal step towards cybersecurity by taking a master's degree in cybersecurity at the International University of Valencia, with the aim of enhancing my work by linking software development and cybersecurity.
